Restaurant Management System
This project is a comprehensive Restaurant Management System built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java and leverages the Apache ecosystem for enhanced functionality and performance. The system is designed to efficiently handle core restaurant operations including reservations, order management, menu handling, billing, and inventory tracking.

Key Features
Object-Oriented Design: Models real-world restaurant entities (tables, customers, menu items, orders, etc.) as Java classes for maintainability and scalability.
Reservation Management: Manage table bookings, cancellations, and schedules seamlessly.
Order Processing: Streamlines order placement, modification, and tracking.
Menu Management: Easily update, add, or remove menu items.
